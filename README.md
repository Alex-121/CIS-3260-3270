# CIS-3260-3270 
This repositoy is a set of assignments for the Georgia State University CIS 3260 and 3270 courses. The assignments walk through the basics of the Java language and progress to more challenging concepts. Everything after chapter 13 will be self taught, as the classes did not cover these concepts but I was intrigued enough to learn.
